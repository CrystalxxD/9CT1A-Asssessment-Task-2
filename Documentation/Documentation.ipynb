    "\n",
    "Change in price of cars as newer models of the car comes out\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Goal: Explanation of what you want to find out using the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing if the cars get more expensive or less expensive as the car model gets newer\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Source: Link to the source of your data.\n",

    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "#### Data Loading: Consider aspects such as ability to load certain file types and handling errors in file loading (e.g. incorrect format, missing files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: The program needs to be able to pull data from files of different formats: . csv, Excel, or JSON. It should also be able to deal with errors such as the wrong format of the file, the file is missing or the availability of the wrong type of file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The basic file format could be either CSV Excel or JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Transferred data in a structured format such as the data structures in Python like Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <br> Data Cleaning: Does the system need to handle missing values or allow for filtering, sorting and grouping of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Some of the real-time data preparation methodologies that should be applied to the program include deleting missing values, screening records, ordering the data by the model’s year, and clustering by the car’s model when necessary. It should be able to deal and report with duplicates and inconsistent records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Raw data (Pandas DataFrame) Cleaning steps (e.g. Empty the missing values or how it is done with duplicates).Selecting and segregating factors (for instance, by the model of cars, by the year of manufacture). \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Data cleaning and structuring (cleaned up data in pandas data frame format ) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <br> Data Analysis: What kind of statistical analysis does the system need to allow for (e.g. mean, median, mode)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: The program should accommodate statistical analysis concerning pricing trends of cars over some time. This might include how to arrive at an average price for each model year, the highest and the lowest prices and more to that, trends in the prices of the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Cleaned data (Pandas DataFrame) \n",
    "Boilerplate parameters: design elements of the analysis (e.g., to compare, and calculate the average, the median, and the differences between prices for the same good in different years). \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Test results, where the average price for a given model year or the change in the price is expressed in a number or a table or summary statistics of results such as mean price per type of model, rate of change of the price and the like. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <br> Data Visualisation: How will the data need to be visualised (e.g. Pandas dataframes / Matplotlib chart types)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: The program should be able to plot the values in one or more charts like line charts to reflect the variation of prices based on time, a Bar chart to compare prices of different models and a scatter diagram to check the price distribution. It would be also logical to expect title customization, label customization, and legend customization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "Data to be analysed or to be used to plot chart (Name of the Pandas Series or DataFrame) \n",
    "Subtype of visualization, namely line chart for price movements and bar chart for price difference. Customization options \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "Visualization aspect of the information (for example creation of a line graph to depict price variation over some time). Exported the developed visualizations in the form of images \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <br> Data Reporting: What output should the system include, and do we need to store the final dataset somewhere (e.g. .csv or .txt file)?\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Description: Another required output is the preparation of a final report of the analysis conducted by the program. This comprises writing the cleaned and analyzed data to a file, for instance, a CSV file as well as saving the visualizations and a written report on the findings. \n",
    " \n",
    "Input: \n",
    "Analyzed data (Pandas DataFrame) \n",
    "Data format and organization of the report, as well as the extension for saving the file (CSV, Excel, .txt, etc. ) \n",
    "FTP address, directory, or folder (for the report to be saved at) \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "A last document file, in the form of a .csv, an. xlsx, a . txt, or a similar file with the analyzed data. \n",
    "Account for retained graphics (for example, . png files). \n",
    "Overall the findings (For example, a . txt file containing the synthesis of the research and the recommendations). \n",
    "This outline can be useful while creating the system to draw the movement of car prices over time by prompting the development of all essential functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases essentially describe how users will interact with the system by providing an example of how it will work. The following example demonstrates how you create a use-case and the template should be used to create a use-case for each functional requirement.\n",
